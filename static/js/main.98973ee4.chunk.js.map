financial hardships. The global trend is that many refugees reside in host countries that have not fully allowed for their integration into the local labor force and native community. Barring refugees from legal employment sets preconditions for two particular concerns: labor and human rights abuses through informal employment arrangements where basic rights are susceptible to abuse; and crippling poverty induced by not having access to jobs that generate a sufficient income. </p>\n      <p style={pStyle}>Poverty is one of the biggest traps refugees find themselves in, and addressing this issue through poverty alleviation programs is key for refugee resettlement and community integration.</p>\n      <p>A ‘cash-based intervention' is any intervention in which cash or vouchers for goods or services are provided to refugees and other persons of concern (PoC) either as individuals or as representatives of a community.</p>\n      <p style={pStyle}><b>Multipurpose cash grants (MPGs)</b> are regular or one-off cash transfers to a household that fully or partially cover a set of basic or recovery needs in different sectors (for instance, for shelter, food, education, and livelihood) and support protection and solutions outcomes. By definition, MPGs are unrestricted cash transfers that put beneficiary choice (the prioritisation by beneficiaries of their own needs) at the centre of programming. They are designed to offer refugees and other PoC as much dignity, flexibility and efficiency as possible commensurate with their needs and capacities.</p>\n      <h2>About Us</h2>\n      <p>This website is an assignment for a Refugee Law class at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and was assembled by students. </p>\n      <p>Anahita Kumar is a master’s student at the University of Pennsylvania studying International Educational Development.

In contrast, only 5 percent of well-off families experienced six or more risk factors, and 19 percent experienced none.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The aggregate of risk factors makes everyday living a struggle; they are multifaceted and interwoven, building on and playing off one another with a devastatingly synergistic effect (Atzaba-Poria, Pike, &amp; Deater-Deckard, 2004). In other words, one problem created by poverty begets another, which in turn contributes to another, leading to a seemingly endless cascade of deleterious consequences. A head injury, for example, is a potentially dire event for a child living in poverty. With limited access to adequate medical care, the child may experience cognitive or emotional damage, mental illness, or depression, possibly attended with denial or shame that further prevents the child from getting necessary help; impairments in vision or hearing that go untested, undiagnosed, and untreated; or undiagnosed behavior disorders, such as AD/HD or oppositional personality disorder.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>It's safe to say that poverty and its attendant risk factors are damaging to the physical, socioemotional, and cognitive well-being of children and their families (Klebanov &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2006; Sapolsky, 2005). Data from the Infant Health and Development Program show that 40 percent of children living in chronic poverty had deficiencies in at least two areas of functioning (such as language and emotional responsiveness) at age 3 (Bradley et al., 1994). The following two sections examine how inferior provisions both at home and at school place poor children at risk for low academic performance and failure to complete school.</span></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <img id=\"imagetext\" src={whycash1} alt=\"Image of Cash Transfer\"/>\n      <p><strong>Why Cash Transfers?</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Cash transfers are a successful method for assisting refugee families who have settled in cities where large distributions of aid are not possible or ineffective.

In Lebanon, refugees have faced restrictive policies that limit their access to work, education, and healthcare. The consequence being that roughly 80% of refugee families live below poverty and have few means to improve their financial circumstances. Cash transfers are effectively a lifeline for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, who depend on such assistance to cover nearly all of their expenses. </span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>In 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/04/refugee-rights-lebanon-not-debate\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Human Rights Watch visited Arsal</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>, a town in Lebanon along the northeast border with Syria.

Min Ila had promising results: enrollment in the afternoon shifts of double shift schools increased by 20%. Similar education-related cash transfer programs have been implemented in both Jordan and Turkey. &nbsp;Within Lebanon, cash transfers have shown promise for reducing three prevalent issues: involuntary return to Syria spurred by extreme poverty and harsh conditions; child labor among Syrian children; and fiscal barriers to accessing school. </span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><strong>Modes of Delivery in MENA</strong></p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Delivering assistance through cash transfers instead of vouchers has positive impacts on refugees. Cash transfers have allowed refugee households to prioritize certain expenses and use their assistance more effectively. The World Food Programme funded a study in Lebanon by the Boston Consulting Group that found cash increased refugees’ purchasing power by up to 19% over vouchers as they did not have to shop at designated shops accepting vouchers. </span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The modes of delivery for cash assistance in the Middle East has grown varied and complicated given the amount of actors involved. In Jordan, several modes of delivery are being used. UNHCR uses the </span><a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/596331dd7.pdf\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Common Cash Facility</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>, in which refugees can access cash assistance through an ATM that uses an iris scan to verify identity. Whereas UNHCR provides refugees with physical cash, Mercy Corps has piloted an alternative cash delivery system under the </span><a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/Mobile%20Wallet_Increased%20Accessibility%20Reduced%20Visibility_0.pdf\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>“Dinarak Mobile App.”</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> The app acts as a platform for making in-store purchases, paying bills, transferring cash, or withdrawing funds at cash-out points.

Mercy Corps led a cash working group to improve coordination of delivery among actors and arrive to a single platform. Four cash-delivery systems are used in Iraq: the World Food Progamme has SCOPE; UNHCR the ASSIST platform; and INGOs used either Last Mile Mobile Solutions (LMMS) and RedRose. In the end, ODFI found that working group did not end with a single, multi-sector platform or greater coordination at a technical level as competition between agencies proved stifled.</span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><strong>Ways to Get Involved in Cash Assistance</strong></p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>There are several ways to get involved with cash assistance advocacy.</span><a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/about-us/overview\"> <span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Cash Learning Partnership</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> (CaLP) is a partnership of humanitarian actors engaged in cash and voucher assistance policy, practice, and research.

The UNRWA Microfinance program has largely been successful, granting over 360,000 loans totaling $400 million.

Implemented appropriately for context, micro-credit programs for refugees could provide a significant number of refugees with formal access to credit. An important consideration is providing opportunities for refugees to expand their financial literacy. Expanded access to programs that successfully allow for repaying micro-credits would reduce the reliance that refugees have on informal models of lending and associated risks. </span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Lending to refugees does not mean higher risk than lending to local populations.

In times past, firms have played an immense role in supporting the development of microfinance institutions. For example, in 2008, </span><a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/making-a-difference-through-microfinance/\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> helped develop an $8.5 million dollar microcredit investment fund in Latin America. </span><a href=\"https://www.orrick.com/api/content/downloadattachment?id=524fed95-cbd6-43f6-b37f-dcdec7f0e164\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Orrick</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> has also advised CHF International on two microfinance projects: funding its affiliated microfinance institution in Jordan by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and assisted in established a microfinance institution in Sudan.</span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>By supporting institutions expanding access to microcredit or establishing their own microcredit funds, firms could increase the availability of credit in the MENA region. Most refugees in MENA host countries have very little access to formal lending, leaving refugee reliant on informal loan schemes. There is a significant need for microcredit institutions that provide loans to refugees–Jordan and Lebanon only have one such institution each. Providing support as Orrick has done could expand credit access for refugees, leading to capital that could be used to start businesses or impact lives in other meaningful ways. </span></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Lawyers could support host governments by offering technical assistance in formulating policies towards more inclusive financial sectors. The German development agency </span><a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/15967.html\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> (GIZ) recently wrapped up a seven year project in which Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Territories received technical assistance in promoting microcredit. Still, in many MENA host countries, financial exclusion remains an issue for low-income populations, particularly refugees. At the policy level, microlending frameworks are a necessary precondition for the growth of formal credit access among refugees. Lawyers can certainly aid host governments in creating legal mechanisms to foster the growth of the microfinance industry and lending to refugees. </span></p>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <img id=\"image\" src={meimage} alt=\"Image of Cash Transfer\"/>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n    <div className=\"text\">\n    <div id=\"rise\">\n    <div>\n      <p><strong>Cash-based Assistance in Asia-Pacific</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Asia-Pacific region is home to 3.3 million refugees, 1.9 million displaced people, and 1.4 million stateless people. The majority of the refugees originate from Afghanistan and Myanmar. Cash-based assistance plays a vital role in combating the refugee crisis throughout Asia and the Pacific. Cash aid enhances peaceful co-existence between refugees and host communities and reduces competition for a limited number of resources. They also enable families to become more self-reliant by encouraging savings, lending, and income generating activities. These programs not only provide vital funds to refugee families, allowing them purchase life-saving necessities, but they also help stimulate the local economies and small business in several severely depressed regions. Compared to voucher programs, which involve a smaller number of market actors, and therefore offer fewer benefits, unrestricted cash assistance benefits a large number of local traders, helping create a more sustainable economic solution.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>International organizations operate active cash-based assistance programs in over 15 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The program in Afghanistan ranks as one of the 10 largest cash transfer operations that the UNHCR operates in the world. Similarly, cash-based assistance has helped stabilize the refugee crisis as thousands of Rohingya flee systematic persecution in Myanmar. In Bangladesh, where three out of four refugees are women or children, cash assistance can reduce their protection risks, such as child exploitation, abuse, trafficking, food borrowing, or firewood gathering.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"><br /><br /></p>\n      <p><strong>Country Spotlight: Bangladesh</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The government and people of Bangladesh have been extraordinarily hospitable to refugees fleeing violence and hardships in their host countries. Specifically, Rohingya people have faced decades of systematic discrimination, statelessness, and targeted violence in Myanmar and have fled to Bangladesh. It is estimated that there are over 1 million refugees currently residing in Bangladesh, making it the largest refugee population in the Asia-Pacific region.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>In Cox’s Bazar, the largest refugee settlement in the world, 80% of the Rohingya population relies on life-saving assistance. The cash transfers to refugees here enable Rohingya households to purchase essential goods at local stores and pay for services not covered by the standardized in-kind distribution or restricted e-vouchers. Furthermore, these cash grants boost the local economy of Cox’s Bazar and allow small and medium traders to grow their businesses and hire more laborers.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Kutapolong camp within Cox’s Bazar settlement provides an excellent example of the impact of successful cash-bashed assistance in the region. The UNHCR, in coordination with the government of Bangladesh, BRAC, and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, has been actively delivering cash transfers to refugees in the settlement. Between April and May 2018 alone, 9,105 families received one-off payments of 2,500 Bangladesh taka (approximately 30 US dollars). This amount provided half of the monthly Minimum Expenditure Basket for a host family of five. Importantly, monitoring of the cash transfers revealed that the cash was safely received by the refugees.

Currently, it may take up to eight weeks for cash to reach affected families. This timeline can extend much longer to reach a significant scale. The speed at which cash reaches its intended recipients can have drastic impacts on their conditions. Delays in delivery may lead to harmful practices like reducing the size of meals, engaging in dangerous work, or selling assets. On the other hand, increasing the speed of cash deliveries can support the recovery of refugees and even make programs more cheaper to administer and more transparent to monitor.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>While some cash-based assistance still occurs through physical transfer of money in Asia, there has been an increasing use of electronic transfers to recipients. These include mobile transfers and deposits to ATM cards that can be easily used in refugee camps throughout the region.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The International Rescue Committee has been piloting and testing an innovative cash delivery program in Asia. Its approach leverages a pre-existing database and a technology-enabled platform to identify people faster, streamline the paperwork, and to process payments to refugees.

Most large and established microfinance institutions (MFI’s) have transformed into Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and have access to deposits and the ability to take on greater leverage. In India, for example, the seven SFBs account for 41% of the MFI lending sector and their loan portfolio exceeds $4bn. At the same time, financial technology is disrupting the industry using digital data and other technology. The advent of machine learning will continue to transform the industry, and many experts predict there will be significant consolidation amongst MFIs in Asia in the future.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Microfinance programs in Asia are increasingly gaining recognition and becoming an &nbsp;important source of funding for those who would otherwise be unable to access credit through traditional financial institutions. The state of the industry differs throughout the continent. For example, in countries such as Bangladesh, India, Philippines, and Indonesia, the industry is fairly mature and well-established. Meanwhile in other countries including China, Myanmar, Russia, and Laos, the sector is nascent and still growing.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Throughout Asia, there is significant room for the growth of the MFI industry. One indicator of the size of the microfinance industry is the ratio of microfinance loans to Gross Domestic Product. In all Asian countries, even those with more established microfinance industries, the ratio is extremely low. India and Bangladesh have two of the more saturated industries, yet there is still a need for increased penetration of MFIs.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>One of the most significant challenges facing the microfinance sector in Asia is the lack of uniformity of regulations throughout the region. All of the countries have different regulators and varying frameworks for controlling and implementing microfinance programs. This presents a significant hurdle for larger institutions and any cooperation between countries. The create of a joint-committee in the region should provide a significant boost to the microfinance industry.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>To learn more about microfinance in Asia, read a PWC report </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/publications/2017/microfinance-in-asia-a-mosaic-future-outlook.pdf\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>, or find other country-specific articles </span><a href=\"https://www.aboutmicrofinance.com/latin-america-caribbean/asia\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>.

Many of these migrants have come through two main entryways: through Turkey or via sea, landing in Greece or the Balkans before dispersing throughout Europe. As such, parts of Europe have a fairly well-developed and successful cash-based assistance regime despite many countries’ unwillingness to accept refugees.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Greece has one of the more successful cash-assistance programs in Europe. Called the Greece Cash Alliance, a partnership of six organizations delivers unrestricted cash grants to refugees and asylum-seekers using proprietary debit cards. This program has been praised by many. In contrast, the cash transfer infrastructure in Turkey is much more limited. In particular, Ankara’s data protection laws make it especially difficult to track and monitor the success of cash transfers. For example, the European Commission has been unable to trace €1bn it spent in 2018 on two humanitarian programs designed to provide cash assistance to Syrian refugees. Auditors have doubts about the money’s final destination given the Turkish government’s refusal to provide access to documents. Given the significant number of refugees entering Turkey from Syria and other parts of the Middle East, these legal and regulatory issues are critical to the success of cash transfer programs in the country.

Private sponsorship allows individuals or community groups to lend their assistance to refugees, primarily through financial support. Over three quarters of the refugees admitted in Europe under financial sponsorship programs over the past six years were admitted by one country: Germany. A more sophisticated, effective, and widely-accepted private sponsorship program throughout the continent will likely require the leadership and support of the European Union.

These NGOs include Catholic Relief Services, the International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, the International Federation of the Red Cross, and Samaritan’s Purse. The GCA was established to harmonize the provision of cash assistance to refugees and asylum-seekers throughout the country. The cash transfers are delivered using the UNHCR Greece Cash Alliance card. The program also tries to utilize the unique capabilities of all of its partners.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Greece Cash Alliance may serve as a model for effective cash-based assistance programs in other countries. The Greek Ministry of Migration Policy sets a standardized eligibility criteria for those seeking to receive funds. It also uses a single database of refugees and asylum-seekers whose records are updated on a monthly basis to prevent duplication and fraud while still ensuring it captures all eligible beneficiaries in a population with significant movement. Furthermore, the program uses a single financial service provider and a single bank card to streamline the process of cash transfers. There is a standardized amount of cash assistance provided based on family size and aid type as well as a single monitoring network that regularly provides results and updates to the administrators. Lastly, there is both a shared helpline and joint communication materials and initiatives in eight languages, making the program accessible to refugees from many backgrounds.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The impact of the Greece Cash Alliance has been significant. In one month alone, the GCA provided cash assistance to 33,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. In 2017, the program transferred over €50m to families in need. As of recent, the GCA has reached 100% of eligible beneficiaries at formal sites across Greece, providing families with essential non-restricted cash grants.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Read more about the Greece Cash Alliance </span><a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/5a14306a7.pdf\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> or </span><a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/resources/casestudies/calp-greece-case-study-web.pdf\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>.</span></p>\n      <p><br /><br /></p>\n      <p><strong>Ways to Get Involved in Europe</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>There are several ways to get involved with cash assistance advocacy.</span><a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/about-us/overview\"> <span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Cash Learning Partnership</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> (CaLP) is a partnership of humanitarian actors engaged in cash and voucher assistance policy, practice, and research.

It has a particular impact in this region given the mature state of the financial services industry and wealth that many residents have compared to poor conditions in which many refugees live. The microfinance sector has been expanding at a breakneck pace recently. The industry has shown double digit growth in single years and has reached more than a 50% growth rate over a period of four years. A significant majority of these loans are made to businesses, with exclusively personal microloans constituting only 16% of the total microloan portfolio. Nonetheless, there is still a tremendous unmet demand for microloans throughout the continent.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The terms and conditions of the microfinance industry in Europe vary greatly between countries. For example, in Poland, Finland, and France, the average annual interest rate for microloans stands at 3%. In contrast, the annual rate for loans in Serbia averages 28%. Furthermore, microfinance institutions target different debtors in different countries. One indicator of a client’s wealth is average loan size to GDP per capita. In some of the more well-developed nations, like Germany (6%), France (11%), Switzerland (12%), and the United Kingdom (16%), institutions target the poorest citizens while in many less-developed Central European countries, these loans are extended more to the country’s middle class with average loan size to GDP per capita exceeding 100%. Many refugees live in the less affluent countries, so extended loans to the poorer segment of the population in these areas will be crucial to aiding refugees trying to build sustainable businesses and livelihoods.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>One significant feature of the microfinance infrastructure in Europe is the coordination amongst institutions in different countries. Although lenders face different challenges and target different clients, there are strong lines of communication and significant collaboration amongst organizations. The European Microfinance Network is the clearest example of this. With over 100 members from throughout the continent, the organization engages in advocacy runs a helpdesk and webinars, facilitates peer-to-peer visits, and conducts working groups and an annual conference. This collaboration and information sharing has allowed the lenders to operate more effectively and efficiently.

More than two decades ago, Mexico and Brazil began to change their approach to poverty reduction. Instead of transferring income to families living in poverty through price subsidies, vouchers, or the direct distribution of food, these governments began to deliver aid through direct cash transfers. These transfers, however, were conditioned on household investments in human capital, like children’s health, nutrition, and education, to ensure that the payments would not be needed on a permanent basis and to promote a more sustainable lifestyle for refugees and the poor. Since then, this model of aid has spread throughout all of Latin America and the Caribbean.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>As crises have become exacerbated in several countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, and El Salvador, the UNHCR has significantly increased its involvement in the region. In 2017, the organization provided cash-based assistance to 25,000 refugees and asylum-seekers living in extreme poverty and at heightened risk in Central America, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Haiti, and Mexico. Additionally, more than 1,700 refugees received cash in Argentina and Costa Rica that year to help them a business or another livelihood activity. The UNHCR also assisted people in concern in Ecuador and Venezuela to access banking services. The scope of this operations, however, still remains limited compared to those in other regions of the world. For reference, none of the UNHCR’s largest cash transfer programs is located in the Americas. In fact, the Americas region represents just 2% of the UNHCR’s budget.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Cash transfer programs have and will become increasingly important in the region going forward. Certain areas have seen as much as a tenfold increase in the number of refugees over the last five years. In order to combat this crisis, increased funding will need to be funneled into the region and governments and private actors will have transition restricted cash grants to more unconditional cash transfers like those used more frequently in other parts of the world.

It is coordinated in conjunction with the Refugee Medical Assistance Program which also provides medical services to those individuals. To be eligible to receive cash transfers through the RCA, beneficiaries must be refugees, asylees or meet one of several other possible statuses. Additionally, there are work and training as well as income requirements for eligibility. Application materials are available in 12 different languages, making the program accessible to people from around the globe. The benefits take the form of unrestricted cash transfers, allowing refugees to attend to their most pressing needs.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Overall, the RCA has been successful in helping refugees begin life in the United States. The program still has some issues, however. Many note that government agencies that serve the general public do not have the specialized knowledge to adequately aid refugee populations. This has led for some to call for increased collaboration between the government and independent organizations. Furthermore, the short eight-month duration of the cash transfers requires refugee families to find work quickly. This may force some refugees into extremely low-paying jobs or situations in which they may be exploited. Refugees also report that benefit levels are low for what they require to live sustainably in the United States.

The cash transfer program in Somalia is one of the agency’s 10 largest in the world, and it has sizeable activity in several other countries. Drought, famine, disease, civil war, and other forms of violence have all contributed to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of individuals from various areas. Cash-based assistance is one of the preferable responses to these challenges because it helps refugees meet their immediate needs and also reduces the risks of rights violations. Additionally, it gives refugees the dignity and autonomy to choose where the money should &nbsp;be spent and to meet their most urgent needs. </span></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, UNHCR increased the scale of its cash assistance operations, distributing cash payments to over 25,000 refugees and internally displaced people in 2018. With these funds, recipients were able to build their own shelters and latrines, enroll children in school, and buy essential supplies. In a country where 83% of affected individuals are women, these cash payments provide critical assistance in a manner with less possibility of rights violations. To distribute the money, UNHCR distributes a mobile phone and SIM card to each family and facilitates the opening of mobile money accounts. This allows not only for secure fund transfers but also allows refugees to communicate with families and friends. Such a program increases integration into the region and boosts the local economy. </span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>To learn more about cash transfers in Africa, </span><a href=\"https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/component/zdocs/document/.../1542\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>click</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> here or </span><a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/afr/news/press/2018/10/5bc03ae04/unhcr-steps-up-cash-assistance-for-refugees-and-displaced-in-the-drc.html\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>. </span></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Country Spotlight: Kenya</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>Cash transfers in Kenya offer an excellent example of the advantages and effectiveness of cash-based assistance compared to other traditional forms of aid. UNHCR runs a program called Cash for Shelter which targets refugees living in the newly-established Kalobeyei settlement in Turkana County. It is the most ambitious cash for shelter program organized by UNHCR to date. The UN Refugee Agency provides cash payments to refugees as they build permanent shelters in the camp. The refugees build compounds of roughly a dozen shelters in an average of 22 days at a cost that is 11-14% lower than that of implementing partners. This allows refugees to spend the remaining funds on home improvements and other basic needs.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> The cash for shelter program in Kenya addresses two critical needs of refugees: it ensures safe and dignified housing while also reducing dependence on humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, it benefits the local economy and improves social co-existence. Cash payments are only made upon timely completion of each building phase, so the program also ensures accountability. As of the end of 2018, the program had provided shelter for over 800 families through the transfer of over $1.5 million. It represents a significant paradigm shift from the traditional refugee camp planning process and allows refugees to transition to more durable solutions, such as integration into the host country.</span></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>To learn more about the Cash for Shelter program in Kenya, click </span><a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/5c487dde4\"><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>here</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>. </span></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>How to Get Involved In Africa</strong></p>\n      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>There are several ways to get involved with cash assistance advocacy.</span><a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/about-us/overview\"> <span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The Cash Learning Partnership</span></a><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}> (CaLP) is a partnership of humanitarian actors engaged in cash and voucher assistance policy, practice, and research.
